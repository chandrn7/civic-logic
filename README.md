# Civic logic: a Mastodon fork

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub. This is *not* the official version of Mastodon; this is a separate version (i.e. a fork). For more information on Mastodon, you can see the [official website](https://joinmastodon.org) and the [upstream repo](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon).
